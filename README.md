Just a little particle simulation program I've made in my free time
Feel free to provide constructive criticism, whether it be reporting bugs or telling me improvents or features I can add to the code


USING THE SIMULATION:

       Left-Click to place particles
       Left-Click and drag to place particles with momentum
       Press space to pause 
       R to reset all particles
       Period to advance one frame
       Drag the sliders to adjust particle properties
