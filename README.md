Just a little particle simulation program I've made in my free time.
If you find a bug or issue in the code, or have ann improvement or feature to add, please put it in the issues.


USING THE SIMULATION:

       Left-Click to place particles
       Left-Click and drag to place particles with momentum
       Press space to pause 
       R to reset all particles
       Period to advance one frame
       Drag the sliders to adjust particle properties
