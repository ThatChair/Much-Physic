## Introduction
This is *Much Physic*, a particle simulation project that is mainly just meant to be something satisfying to experiment with. This simulation is a work in progress, and I continually strive to improve it in my spare time.

## Features
+ Simple 2d particle physics simulation
+ Includes collisions both between particles and ground
+ Currently contains one force: gravity (both universal and particle-to-particle)

## Controls

### Keys
| Key | Action |
| :---: | :---: |
| Left Click | Spawn New Particle |
| Left Cick + Drag | Spawn New Particle with Velocity |
| Space | Toggle Simulation |
| R | Reset Simulation | 
| . (Period) | Advance Simulation One Frame |

### Sliders
Currently, you can change the properties of each particle you spawn with sliders. Below details what each slider does.
| Slider | Effect |
| :---: | :---: |
| Particle Sixe (Px) | Changes the Radius in Pixels of the Particle|
| Particle Mass | Changes the Mass of the Particle, which Influences how it Interacts with Other Particles |
| Particle Elasticity (%) | Changes the Elasticity of the Particle, which Inflciences how bouncy it is |
| Universal Gravity Multiplier | Changes the Amount of Universal Gravity, Which Pulls all Particles Down | 

## Download and Installation
1. Head to the releases page [here](https://github.com/XD5000/Much-Physic/releases)
2. Download the most recent zip file, which will be titled something like "Much_Physic-vX.X.X.zip"
3. Extract the zip file
4. Run the .exe file within the folder
5. Enjoy!
